The entire process is done in the 'main' function.
It reads the data, both test and train.
'stripoutcome' strips the labels of each data point.
'classifierprob' calculates the frequency of 1's and 0's.
'testprobC' returns 4 lists:
1. Probability of test = 1 given classifier is 1.
2. Probability of test = 1 given classifier is 0.
3. Probability of test = 0 given classifier is 1.
4. Probability of test = 1 given classifier is 0.
Data is trained at this point.
'testfunction' calculates accuracy on the test data.
It traverses across each set of test data and checks if that particular test is 1 or 0 and multiplies it with the respective variable.
At the end of loop, there's an if condition which classifies every 1 and 0.
To improve accuracy, I have added Laplace smoothing and submitted it in a seperate file.
